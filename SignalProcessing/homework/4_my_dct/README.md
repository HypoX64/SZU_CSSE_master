## Run  code
```shell
python image_dct_and_idct.py
```
## Result:
QF=1 | QF=20 | QF=50 | QF=100 
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
![image](./images/QF=1.png) | ![image](./images/QF=20.png) | ![image](./images/QF=50.png) | ![image](./images/QF=100.png) | 
* We can find that image will get worse quality when QF is larger. 
* When quantfy  DCT blocks, it will loss more information when QF is large.
